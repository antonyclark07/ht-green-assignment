        Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with
        LEDs, got a new fridge and super-efficient heat pump and youre still
        paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT Green work with
        you to design and install a system that uses solar, wind or geothermal
        that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and into the future.

        Solar Photovoltaic systems have come of age. Installers now can
        guarantee reliable cost-free power to your home or business. ROI is now
        taking less time than ever thanks to the ever decreasing equipment costs
        and better technology.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have battery storage such as a Tesla Powerwall or similar Lithium
        Ion chemistry solutions then you can take your savings even further.

        Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is
        warmer than the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green can
        engineer a solution to fit your situation to give you free plentiful
        home warming energy year-round.
        <br />
        <br />
        Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally
        friendly, but has previously been geographically limited to areas near
        tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have
        dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially
        for direct applications such as home heating.
        <br />
        <br />
        Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within
        the earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional
        fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help
        mitigate global warming if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.

        If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to engineer a
        wind turbine system that generates electricity when the wind blows. Team
        a wind turbine with a solar PV system and you increase your energy
        generation potential.

        New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind turbine
        works, the benefits of wind energy and how a wind turbine is installed.

        <br />
        If you're not sure on the type of turbine you need, before you buy from
        us, contact one of our wind power experts for the right advice.
